## C Programming: Getting Started

This is my first attempt at learning the C-language. The problems are presented by the course staff, and relate to simple operations using the C-language. Topics included integers, doubles, characters, and basic concepts such as ```for``` loops.

These are very simple programs, and I am writing them and uploading to GitHub for posterity more than anything.

I am also uploading this seemingle *useless* code to get the hang of Git, and GitHub.
